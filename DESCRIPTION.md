### Accounts

This app integrates with Cloudron authentication. Cloudron users can login and use Nextcloud.

However, _admin_ status of Cloudron user is not carried over to Nextcloud. For this reason,
this app comes with an pre-setup admin user. This admin user can grant admin previleges to
other users.

`username`: admin

`password`: changeme

**Please change the admin password on first login**
